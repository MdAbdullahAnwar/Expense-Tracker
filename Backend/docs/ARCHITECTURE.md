# Backend Architecture

## Overview

The backend follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Routes Layer
- Defines API endpoints
- Maps HTTP methods to controllers
- Located in `/routes`

### 2. Controllers Layer
- Handles HTTP requests/responses
- Validates input
- Calls service layer
- Located in `/controllers`

### 3. Services Layer
- Contains business logic
- Manages database transactions
- Handles data processing
- Located in `/services`

### 4. Models Layer
- Defines database schemas
- Sequelize ORM models
- Located in `/models`

### 5. Middleware Layer
- Authentication (JWT verification)
- Request validation
- Error handling
- Located in `/middlewares`

## Request Flow

```
Client Request
    ↓
Routes (endpoint mapping)
    ↓
Middleware (auth, validation)
    ↓
Controller (request handling)
    ↓
Service (business logic)
    ↓
Model (database operations)
    ↓
Database (MySQL)
    ↓
Response back through layers
```

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. MVC Pattern
- **Model**: Database schemas and ORM
- **View**: JSON responses
- **Controller**: Request handlers

### 2. Service Pattern
- Business logic separated from controllers
- Reusable service functions
- Transaction management

### 3. Repository Pattern
- Sequelize models act as repositories
- Abstract database operations

### 4. Middleware Pattern
- Authentication middleware
- Error handling middleware

## Transaction Management

All database operations use Sequelize transactions to ensure:
- **Atomicity**: All or nothing operations
- **Consistency**: Data integrity maintained
- **Isolation**: Concurrent operations don't interfere
- **Durability**: Committed changes persist

Example:
```javascript
const transaction = await sequelize.transaction();
try {
  // Database operations
  await transaction.commit();
} catch (error) {
  await transaction.rollback();
  throw error;
}
```

## Security

- JWT tokens for authentication (1 hour expiry)
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Environment variables for secrets
- SQL injection prevention via Sequelize
- CORS enabled for frontend

## Error Handling

- Centralized error handling
- Consistent error response format
- Transaction rollback on errors
- Detailed error logging

## Scalability Considerations

- Stateless authentication (JWT)
- Database connection pooling
- Transaction-based operations
- Modular code structure
